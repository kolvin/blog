## Humble beginnings

In this post I share the progression of my home work+play station over the years

Running DayZ on the big screen, trying to get the tactical advantage but I was still shit

<Image src={sensibletripplescreens} alt="tripple monitor setup, 3 different sizes"/>

After deciding I didn't want to burn my retinas, I scaled down to a sensibly sized triple monitor setup

Also migrated to a new keyboard, the [Razer Deathstalker](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Razer-DeathStalker-Backlight-Membrane-Programmable/dp/B014OPALM8)

<Image src={pubesentme} alt="me"/>

My setup was chaotic and I loved it

Life was good but I spent more time out drinking with mates than learning new technologies, I always felt this in my day job as a Junior Engineer

I lacked direction and motivation in what felt like a very intimidating industry

But I had also developed an obsession with setups so I had to get my graft oan $$$

## 2017

> Apple Macbook Pro 14,3/i7-7820HQ/16GB Ram/512GB SSD/15'/560 4GB Grey/A Laptops - MacOSX

<Image src={steviejobbie} alt="Apple Macbook Pro 14,3/i7-7820HQ/16GB Ram/512GB SSD/15'/560 4GB Grey/A Laptops - MacOSX"/>

[Model](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP754?locale=en_GB)

After working up to a mid-level engineer in early 2017, i bought my first overpriced Macbook Pro at a grand total of **£2428.80** 

Which i recently sold in (2021) for **£479.00**

## 2018

After moving a few times, I finally settled into a new flat where I kinda neglected my Desktop for a little while

I was spending a lot of time doing development on my Macbook and stopped gaming as much

Same setup but on a slighter bigger desk

Switched back to a Mechanical keyboard
- [Blackwidow Razer Mechanical Keyboard](https://vision-techno.com/en/product/140/RAZER+Blackwidow+Chroma+V2/) (Green switches)

## 2019

### Scan-gate

After consulting for a few months I put some of my profits into a beastly workstation. I bought my second pre-build Desktop from [Scan](https://www.scan.co.uk/) and it cost a grand total **£3512.48**

> 3XS Vengeance Fluid Ti RTX, Watercooled Intel Core i9 9900K "Coffee Lake", 16GB DDR4, 11GB NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti, 500GB SSD

<Image src={scanMvp1} alt="White gaming pc with red coloured water coolant"/>

[Base Model](https://www.scan.co.uk/3xs/configurator/3xs-vengeance-fluid-rtx-intel)

The hilarious thing here is that after paying tooth and nail for a professionally built system, It arrived with a pipe leak which had wrote off a brand new [RTX 2080ti 11GB](https://www.nvidia.com/en-me/geforce/graphics-cards/rtx-2080-ti/) worth around **£2k**


After hours of mourning I returned the first build and few weeks later recived my second build with some complimentary upgrades
- Collant colour change to [White EK-CryoFuel](https://www.scan.co.uk/products/1000ml-ek-cryofuel-water-cooling-premixed-fluid-solid-cloud-white-cu-brass-stainless-steel-friendly)
- Additional [M.2 500GB SSD](https://www.scan.co.uk/products/512gb-intel-ssd-660p-series-m2-2280-pcie-30-x4-nvme-ssd-qlc-3d-nand-1500mb-s-read-1000mb-s-write-90k)

<Image src={scanMvp2} alt="White gaming pc with white coloured water coolant"/>

Luckly this build arrived in a healthy condition and I was running it for about a month or so when...

One day I sat down to play some [Rust](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiZ5OKul5D6AhWAQ0EAHWvWCHMQFnoECAwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F252490%2FRust%2F&usg=AOvVaw2LFz-apk7XNUUieFwQr1pr) and as the game lauched, a coolant pipe had exploded at eyelevel

<Image src={scanMvp2burst} alt="Custom PC water cooling going wrong"/>

I vividly remember watching the coolant continue to pump out over the GPU as my arse collapsed

After a shit tonne of complaining I was sent my fourth and final build that included an extra radiator to matain the heat levels coupled with re-inforced tubing

Upon setup I could tell this build was much more sturdy and thankfully had no leaks

Finally I had a healthy machine!
