## Humble beginnings

In this post I share the progression of my home work+play station over the years

in chronological order

## 2016

> Intel I7 4790 Quad Core Gaming Pc Computer 1tb 16Gb Nvidia GTX 960 2GB Galaxy

My first Desktop, pre-built from [Ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/) and it cost a grand total **£676.99**

First time upgrading accessories;
- [Triton PRO+ Headset](https://trittonaudio.com/prod/proplus.php)
- [Blackwidow Razer Mechanical Keyboard](https://vision-techno.com/en/product/140/RAZER+Blackwidow+Chroma+V2/) (Green switches)
- [Razer Orochi](https://www.razer.com/gb-en/gaming-mice/Razer-Orochi-V2/RZ01-03730400-R3G1) - [fingertip style](#grip-styles)

I also picked up a caffeine addiction..

Running DayZ on the big screen, trying to get the tactical advantage but I was still shit

---

<Image src={sensibletripplescreens} alt="tripple monitor setup, 3 different sizes"/>

After deciding I didn't want to burn my retinas, I scaled down to a sensibly sized triple monitor setup

Also migrated to a new keyboard, the [Razer Deathstalker](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Razer-DeathStalker-Backlight-Membrane-Programmable/dp/B014OPALM8)

---

<Image src={pubesentme} alt="me"/>

My setup was chaotic and I loved it

Life was good but I spent more time out drinking with mates than learning new technologies, I always felt this in my day job as a Junior Engineer

I lacked direction and motivation in what felt like a very intimidating industry

But I had also developed an obsession with setups so I had to get my graft oan $$$

## 2017

> Apple Macbook Pro 14,3/i7-7820HQ/16GB Ram/512GB SSD/15'/560 4GB Grey/A Laptops - MacOSX

<Image src={steviejobbie} alt="Apple Macbook Pro 14,3/i7-7820HQ/16GB Ram/512GB SSD/15'/560 4GB Grey/A Laptops - MacOSX"/>

[Model](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP754?locale=en_GB)

After working up to a mid-level engineer in early 2019, i bought my first overpriced Macbook Pro at a grand total of **£2428.80** 

Which i recently sold in (2021) for **£479.00**

## 2018

After moving a few times, I finally settled into a new flat where I kinda neglected my Desktop for a little while

I was spending a lot of time doing development on my Macbook and stopped gaming as much

Same setup but on a slighter bigger desk

Switched back to a Mechanical keyboard
- [Blackwidow Razer Mechanical Keyboard](https://vision-techno.com/en/product/140/RAZER+Blackwidow+Chroma+V2/) (Green switches)

<Image src={preUpgrade} alt="triple monitor setup on bigger desk"/>

## Early 2019

### Scan-gate

After consulting for a few months I put some of my profits into a beastly workstation. I bought my second pre-build Desktop from [Scan](https://www.scan.co.uk/) and it cost a grand total **£3512.48**

> 3XS Vengeance Fluid Ti RTX, Watercooled Intel Core i9 9900K "Coffee Lake", 16GB DDR4, 11GB NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti, 500GB SSD

<Image src={scanMvp1} alt="White gaming pc with red coloured water coolant"/>

[Base Model](https://www.scan.co.uk/3xs/configurator/3xs-vengeance-fluid-rtx-intel)

The hilarious thing here is that after paying tooth and nail for a professionally built system, It arrived with a pipe leak which had wrote off a brand new [RTX 2080ti 11GB](https://www.nvidia.com/en-me/geforce/graphics-cards/rtx-2080-ti/) worth around **£2k**

After hours of mourning I returned the first build and few weeks later recived my second build with some complimentary upgrades
- Collant colour change to [White EK-CryoFuel](https://www.scan.co.uk/products/1000ml-ek-cryofuel-water-cooling-premixed-fluid-solid-cloud-white-cu-brass-stainless-steel-friendly)
- Additional [M.2 500GB SSD](https://www.scan.co.uk/products/512gb-intel-ssd-660p-series-m2-2280-pcie-30-x4-nvme-ssd-qlc-3d-nand-1500mb-s-read-1000mb-s-write-90k)

<Image src={scanMvp2} alt="White gaming pc with white coloured water coolant"/>

Luckly this build arrived in a healthy condition and I was running it for about a month or so when...

One day I sat down to play some [Rust](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiZ5OKul5D6AhWAQ0EAHWvWCHMQFnoECAwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F252490%2FRust%2F&usg=AOvVaw2LFz-apk7XNUUieFwQr1pr) and as the game lauched, a coolant pipe had exploded at eyelevel

<Image src={scanMvp2burst} alt="Custom PC water cooling going wrong"/>

I vividly remember watching the coolant continue to pump out over the GPU as my arse collapsed

[Orginal reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/watercooling/comments/d6y5l1/at_least_my_components_are_cool_right/)

After a shit tonne of complaining I was sent my fourth and final build that included an extra radiator to matain the heat levels coupled with re-inforced tubing

Upon setup I could tell this build was much more sturdy and thankfully had no leaks

Finally I had a healthy machine!

## Mid 2019

Running my new workstation with a single monitor, I liked the minimal feel here.

Loved having my guitars mounted above too

<Image src={postUpgrade} alt="Workstation with single monitor"/>

But I need another screen right?

<Image src={preMegadesk} alt="Monitor mout fixed on wall"/>

Line em up

<Image src={floatyMegadesk} alt="Monitor mouted workstation"/>

And breathe

Kit upgraded
- [Primay monitor](https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/a7e41287)
- [Vertical monitor](https://www.currys.co.uk/products/samsung-c24f396-full-hd-24-curved-led-monitor-10146138.html)
- [Razer Deathadder](https://www.razer.com/gb-en/gaming-mice/razer-deathadder-v2) - [claw style](#grip-styles)

Milo liked killing newspawns with his AK and Rockets

## 2020

Pretty please with a monitor on top?

Okay

<Image src={megadeskAngle1} alt="Triple monitor workstation"/>

Sitting angle

<Image src={megadeskAngle2} alt="Triple monitor workstation"/>

Probably one of my cosiest setups to date and one of my favorites


## 2021

In early July we moved from [Glasgow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow) -> [Poole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poole)

Retained the triple monitor setup but picked up a proper mounting arm to avoid leaving holes in walls

<Image src={postMoving} alt="unfinished workstation.. eww"/>

I then installed the base of the arm through my wooden ikea desk it was perfectly snug and solid to hold some serious weight
- [Monitor arm](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08DH81TS3?ref=em_1p_0_ti&ref_=pe_2443691_720383601)
- [Desk](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/lisabo-table-black-80382439/) (£149)
- [Apex Pro TKL - Keyboard](https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-pro-tkl/) (£189.99)

Packed up my now 8th workstation to relocate. sigh

Switched keyboard here
