## Acoustic - 1/3

<Image src={acoustic} alt="Good acoustic for the a casual wee strum"/>

[Model](https://www.jasmineguitars.com/product/jo-37ce/)

Great for knocking out the sash or wonderwall. Kidding.

This is a great guitar, the action is just right so can play comfortably

Ive definetly played nicer acoustics but this one is grand for just busking away for a bit

which is all i really do

## Electric 2/3

[Model](https://www.jacksonguitars.com/en-US/body-shape/dinky/js-series-dinky-js11/2910121503.html)

My oldest guitar and probably my favorite, has the PERFECT action

I learned a lot of Parkway Drive on this beast

Very special to me

## Electric 3/3

<Image src={schecter} alt="my oldest guitar and probably my favorite"/>

[Model](https://www.schecterguitars.com/Omen-7_2)

My most recent purchase about 4 years back, get some stupid low tunings with this thing

Lowest ive been is probably Drop G

Hardest song learned so far; [Periphery - All new materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdQFDKB0gig)

This is my trusty audio input, here i wire my [TRS cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS_cable) in

Used in conjunction with [Garageband](https://www.apple.com/uk/mac/garageband/)

## String Theory

After some light research I bought these bendy fuckers, so nice on the finger, light and reliable
